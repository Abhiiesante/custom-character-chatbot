    "Rationale:\n",
    "I selected the 'character_descriptions.csv' dataset because it contains rich text about fictional characters, including their description, medium (theater, television, film), and setting (fantasy world, modern city, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of data is perfect for custom chatbot prompts because:\n",
    "- It requires understanding of complex descriptive text (not just facts).\n",
    "- Good matching between a user's question and a character depends on nuanced features like bravery, detective skills, or world setting.\n",
    "- The custom retrieval will select better context than a generic model without access to this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without custom context, a general LLM would respond very vaguely (\"Here is a brave character: Superman.\")  \n",
    "With custom context, the LLM will give targeted answers (\"A brave character from a fantasy world: 'Liora the Dragonrider from Zephyra'.\")\n"
